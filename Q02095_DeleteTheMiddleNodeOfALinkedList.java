/*
You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node. 
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Example 3:


Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
1 <= Node.val <= 105

/*時間複雜度:O(n) -> fast一次跑兩步，while 只會跑約 n/2 次，成長率與 n 成正比。
  空間複雜度:O(1) -> 僅使用固定數量指標變數
記得邊界檢查，if 長度n=1，n/2個=1，因此要回傳空linkedlist
